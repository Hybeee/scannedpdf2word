# scannedpdf2word

This repository contains a program that can turned a scanned pdf - which is not searchable, and is harder to understand for AI engines like copilot - into a searchable word/pdf document.

Usage:
In the root of the repository: 
```
python main.py [path/to/your/pdf] [result_directory]
```

[result_directory] is optional, in case it's not given, the result directory is created in the same directory as the program.
